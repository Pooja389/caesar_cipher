# Caesar Cipher

## Description

This is a Python implementation of the Caesar cipher, a simple encryption technique where each letter in a word is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. The program supports both encoding and decoding of messages based on a user-specified shift value.

## How to Use

1. **Encoding**: Shift each letter of the input word forward in the alphabet by the specified number of positions.
2. **Decoding**: Shift each letter of the encoded word backward by the same number of positions to retrieve the original word.

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python caesar.py
